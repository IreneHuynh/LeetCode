Question 1450: Number of students Doing Homework at a Given Time

Brute force:

This is just a simple logic question, if the time of query is between the start and end time then we know that that student was busy and we just count that student

const busyStudent = (startTime, endTime, queryTime) => {
  let count = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < startTime.length; i++) {
    let start = startTime[i];
    let end = endTime[i];

    if (start <= queryTime && queryTime <= end) count++
  }

  return count;
}

Question 1482: Minimum Numbers of Days to Make m Bouquets---------------------------------------------Question 1482: Minimum Numbers of Days to Make m Bouquets

Brute force, this is essentially a search problem. We are trying to search through the array to see if we can collect m*k flowers such that each m bouquets consist of k adjacent flowers. We are checking if we can make a m bouquets of k flowers in our helper. We are simply increasing the mid and checking if we can make m bouquets of k within that array.

var minDays = function(bloomDay, m, k) {
    if(m*k > bloomDay.length)return -1
    let start = 0,end = Math.max(...bloomDays),final=-1
    
    while(start <= end){
          let mid = Math.floor((start+end)/2)
          if(helper(bloomDay,m,k,mid)){
              end = mid - 1
              final = mid
          }else{
              start = mid+1
          }
    }
    return final
};

var helper = (days,m,k,mid)=>{
    let count=0,total=0
    for(let i=0;i<days.length;i++){
        if(days[i] <= mid){
            count++
            if(count == k){
                total++
                count = 0
            }
        }else{
            count = 0
        }
    }
    return total >= m
}
