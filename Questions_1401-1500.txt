Question 1482: Minimum Numbers of Days to Make m Bouquets---------------------------------------------Question 1482: Minimum Numbers of Days to Make m Bouquets

Brute force, this is essentially a search problem. We are trying to search through the array to see if we can collect m*k flowers such that each m bouquets consist of k adjacent flowers. We are checking if we can make a m bouquets of k flowers in our helper. We are simply increasing the mid and checking if we can make m bouquets of k within that array.

var minDays = function(bloomDay, m, k) {
    if(m*k > bloomDay.length)return -1
    let start = 0,end = Math.max(...bloomDays),final=-1
    
    while(start <= end){
          let mid = Math.floor((start+end)/2)
          if(helper(bloomDay,m,k,mid)){
              end = mid - 1
              final = mid
          }else{
              start = mid+1
          }
    }
    return final
};

var helper = (days,m,k,mid)=>{
    let count=0,total=0
    for(let i=0;i<days.length;i++){
        if(days[i] <= mid){
            count++
            if(count == k){
                total++
                count = 0
            }
        }else{
            count = 0
        }
    }
    return total >= m
}
