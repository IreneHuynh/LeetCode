Question 1313: Decompress Run-length Encoder

Brute force would be to make multiple arrays and append them together, here, the reducer function would help

var decompressRLElist = function(nums) {
  return nums.reduce(
    (acc, cur, i, arr) =>
      i % 2 ? [...acc, ...Array(arr[i - 1]).fill(cur)] : acc,
    []
  );
};
